This folder stores very small but useful modules.

Module moduleFileDialog.py is used to open dialog
that allows user to select file using GUI.

Module moduleFilePathFormer is used to create paths
from one directory to files and directories inside 
of it. It is currently poorly documented and should
be documented more or replaced.

Module moduleGameClock.py is used to instantiate
GameClock that can be used to separate logic cycles
from drawing cycles and ensure constant game speed
across all systems.
