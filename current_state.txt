This file is used to describe current state of the project.

Currently game engine contains only moduleLevelPlayer.py
that is used to load levels and modules that can be used 
by it. 

moduleLevelPlayer.py is the "game" itself currently so
to launch the game, it is necessary to launch moduleLevelPlayer.py.
moduleLevelPlayer.py now loads only Level_1 from the example game.

Only WIP (Work in process) GUI and core functions of the LevelPlayer 
are currently implemented but they are still far from finished.
Terrain can be loaded and shown by GUI but users can't do anything but
close the game window yet.
